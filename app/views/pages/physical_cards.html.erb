    <p>We are designing physical Monster Cards to use at the game table. No more flipping back and forth through a book in the middle of combat - just keep the few cards that you will need for your session on hand! Each card will display all the stats for a single monster and you can show players the cool illustration on the back side of the card.</p>
    </p>
    <p>The front of the card contains all the same information as you would find here, on monstercards.ca, but with an even nicer design. We are optimizing the layout for the best possible table experience. You can even expect fun extras, like a list of individual quirks, for cards with extra space.</p>
    <p>The back of the cards will each have a unique illustration from the vary talented <a href="https://www.artstation.com/amycornelson">Amy Cornelson</a>.</p>
    <p>To raise money for manufacturing and for more illustrations, we plan to take this project to Kickstarter in the near future. You can buy a deck of the cards there.</p>
